# Mechatronics

- This repository contains homework and project assignments for a Mechatronics course.
- Each assignment is provided in PDF format along with corresponding answer files.

## Repository Structure


### Home Works
- `HW0.pdf` - This homework is all about getting warmed up for coding in Python
and C++, as it will be a key asset for the rest of the course.
- `HW1.pdf` - This homework covers various basic mechatronics concepts such as: rotation, plucker line, mathematical background and etc..
- `HW2.pdf` - This homework covers D-H parameters, FKP, and IKP problems.
- `HW3.pdf` - This assignment is designed to help you develop a better understanding of trajectory generation
and jacobian concepts and use cases.
- `HW4.pdf` - This homework covers IKP, (non)rotating frames, dynamic equation using Lagrangian and Newtonian methods.
- `HW5.pdf` - This homework is an introduction to the kinematic analysis of the redundant planar serial manipulators.
- `HW6.pdf` - This homework covers basic AI and ML concepts in robotics: back propagation, perception learning, svm, CNN forward process, IKP with MLP, and CNN classification.

### Projects
- `MP1.pdf` - This project covers four problems by using MPU-6050 and Arduino. The problems are 1. Angle Recording using MPU-6050, 2. Angle Filtering, 3. MPU-6050 as a Game Controller(in a maze), 4. Motion Capturing Using MediaPipe
- `MP2.pdf` - This project is designed to address the kinematics and dynamics of robotic arms using
MATLAB and Simscape environment.
- `MP3.pdf` - This project is designed to getting familiar with turtlesim, the 2D simulator of ROS.
- `MP4.pdf` - This project is designed to use deep learning in the realm of object detection to propose a
method to automatically pack custom catering packages.
